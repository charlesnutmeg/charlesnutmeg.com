    <h2 class=introcn>About Charles Nutmeg</h2>
    <p>
      Charles Nutmeg is actually a guinea pig who is not actually alive but that's too bad. Moving on. He is made of duct tape and scraps of fabric. On the bright side if he falls in a pool of Jell-o then just throw him in the washingmachine. He doesn't hold grudges.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Now let's talk about me. My favorite color EVER is  bright green. I like cats, mice, guinea pigs, and basically any animal I see. I have a cat named Neo, <a href="mice.html">two mice</a> named Elephant and Coffee Bean or Bean, and two fish named Coraline and Peaches n' Cream aka PC. Surprisingly, that actually works! I also love to play the violin, clarinet, and piano. I also enjoy composing music.
