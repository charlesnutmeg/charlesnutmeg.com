    <h2>About Charles Nutmeg</h2>
    <p>
      Charles Nutmeg is actually a guinny pig who is not actually
      alive but that's too bad. Moving on. He is made of duct
      tape and scraps of fabric. On the bright side if he falls
      in a pool of Jell-o then just throw him in the washing
      machine. He doesn't hold grudges.
