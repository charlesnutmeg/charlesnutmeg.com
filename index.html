    <h2 class=introcn>About Charles Nutmeg</h2>
    <p>
      Charles Nutmeg is actually a guinea pig who is not actually
      alive but that's too bad. Moving on. He is made of duct
      tape and scraps of fabric. On the bright side if he falls
      in a pool of Jell-o then just throw him in the washing
      machine. He doesn't hold grudges.

    <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Now let's talk about me. My favorite color EVER is
        bright green. I like cats, mice, and guinea pigs.
        I have a cat named Neo, two mice named Frost and
        Coffee Bean or FeeBea, and two fish named Cherry Stem and
        Peaches n' Cream aka PC. Surprisingly, that actually
        works! I also love to play the violin and piano.
        I also enjoy composing music.
