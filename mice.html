    <h1>The Adorababies</h1>
    <p>
      I mentioned Frost and Coffee Bean earlier so I won't keep
      you waiting any longer. Here's the inside scoop on (as I like
      to call them) THE ADORABABIES!!!

    </p>
    <h2>Coffee Bean</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Coffee Bean</strong> is probably the most nicknamed mouse I know.
      Her names are Coffee Bean, Coffeea Beana, Fee Bea, Fee fee,
      The Bean, and Princess Coffeea Beana!
    </p>
    <h2>Frost</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Frost</strong> doesn't really have any nicknames, but she is
      famous for her early morning workout routine. EVERY MORNING
      she gets up and runs on her wheel for 5-10 minutes. After
      that she goes to sleep and is not seen or heard from until
      the evening!
