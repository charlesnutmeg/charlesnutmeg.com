    <h1>The Adorababies</h1>
    <p>
      I mentioned Elephant and Coffee Bean earlier so I won't keep you waiting any longer. Here's the inside scoop on (as I like to call them) THE ADORABABIES!!!
    </p>
    <h2>Coffee Bean</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Coffee Bean</strong> is probably the most nicknamed mouse I know. Her names are Coffee Bean, Coffeea Beana, Fee Bea, Fee fee, Bean, and Princess Coffeea Beana! Her favorite food is little chunks of apple.
    </p>
    <h2>Elephant</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Elephant</strong> has the biggest ears in proportion to her head that I have ever seen. As you can probably guess, she is SUPER cute! Elephant and Coffee Bean are best friends, and share two cages connected by a habitrail tube. Elephant's favorite food is sunflower seeds.
